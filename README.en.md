The MyFilms application has implemented responsive design. For a full assessment
of it, after changing the screen width using developer tools, it is preferable
to reload the page. Additionally, a backend has been implemented, the code of
which can be viewed at the following link:

!!! Possible hang-ups during the first launch after a long break, as the backend
is deployed on a free server !!!
